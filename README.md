# Contact Book Script

The **Contact Book Script** is a Python program designed to manage contacts, allowing users to add, view, search, delete contacts, and optionally save the contact book to a CSV file.

## Purpose

The purpose behind creating this script is to provide a simple yet effective way to manage personal contacts directly from the command line or terminal. This script was made to further my skills and understanding of while-loops and functions during my education at EC Utbildning (2022-2024).
